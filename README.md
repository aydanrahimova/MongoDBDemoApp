# BookstoreApp

## Overview

This is a simple Bookstore application built to practice the basics of MongoDB. The app performs CRUD (Create, Read,
Update, Delete) operations for managing authors and books, with the primary goal of understanding and testing MongoDB
functionalities.

## Features

- **Author Management**: Create, read, update, and delete author records.
- **Book Management**: Create, read, update, and delete book records associated with authors.
- **MongoDB Relations**:  In this project, I practiced and implemented basic relationships between authors and books
  using MongoDB's embedded documents and references.

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to provide hands-on experience with MongoDB, particularly in understanding how to model relationships in a NoSQL database. By working with MongoDB's features, such as references and embedded documents, I was able to test how data can be structured and managed efficiently in a simple CRUD application.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend**: Java, Spring Boot
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **ORM**: Spring Data JPA
- **API Documentation**: Swagger
- **Build Tool**: Gradle
- **Version Control**: Git, GitHub
- **Containerization**: Docker
